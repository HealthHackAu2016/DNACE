# DNACE

https://octicons.github.com/icon/beaker

Problem presented/Challenge: general public doesnt show interest in genomics due to technicisim and lack of basic knowldege.

Solution: Provide a DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) experience based on genomics that attracts public and provides basic genomic concepts that would bring people into it.

James F = Problem owner & mentor

Elise & Sylvain = Creating DDR visuals. User interface development based in user experience (USUI) and associated hardware (existing dance mats or hacked solutions)

James H = Interface functuallity. Xx developing? flow, stream reading and key events.

Louis & Angela = Music producers. Establish the relationship between the cords and the base pairs to create a melody. Getting the DNA string from a database and reading that into different chords.

Araitz = Connecting work ;)

“Chord” DNA String (human) for each set of 4 letters if first 2 letters are:
GT
GA
then play Cdim

if first 2 letters are:
GC
GG
then play Daug

if first 2 letters are:
TT
TA
CT
then play D#m

if first 2 letters are:
TC

AA
AC
then play F#Aug

if first 2 letters are:
AT
AG
then play G#

if first 2 letters are:
CC
CG
Then play: A#aug

“melodic” DNA string embedded if for a different string input, based on each above chord  
Melodic string for each 4 letters
if
G= base note (of chord arpeggio)
if
T = 2nd note(of chord arpeggio)
if
A = 3rd note( of chord arpeggio)
if
C = Octave/4th note if diminished/4 note chord structure( of chord arpeggio)


“bass” DNA string note based on chord also,
For each SET of 4 letters,
if first letter is:
G, then play basenote ( of chord arpeggio)
T = 2nd note (of chord arpeggio)
A = 3rd note(of chord arpeggio)
