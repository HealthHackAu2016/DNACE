# DNACE

Problem presented/Challenge: general public doesnt show interest in genomics due to technicisim and lack of basic genomic knowldege.

Solution: Provide a DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) experience based on genomics that attracts public and provides basic genomic concepts that would bring more people into it.

James F = Problem owner & mentor

Elise & Sylvain = Creating DDR visuals. User interface development based in user experience (USUI) and associated hardware (existing dance mats or hacked solution)

James H = Interface functuallity. Xx developing? flow, stream reading and key events.

Louis & Angela = Music producers. Establish the relationship between the cords and the base pairs to create a melody. Getting the DNA string from a database and reading that into different chords.

Araitz = Connecting work ;)
